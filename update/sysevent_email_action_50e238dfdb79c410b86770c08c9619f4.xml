<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Dear ${name},</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Thank you for taking the time to continue your enrollment into the STUDY on our CHARMS website. This notice is your final request for additional enrollment information for the LFSS study.&nbsp; If you do not complete the ADD QUESTIONNAIRES as requested below, your CHARMS account will be suspended and your enrollment in the study halted.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Please remember that you may start and stop these forms at any time, however the are only considered completed when you click submit.<br /><br /></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">In the next 10 days, please log into CHARMS (website) and complete the following new items listed below. You are able to start, save, and restart these questionnaires if needed.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; list-style-position: inside;">
<li style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family History Questionnaire</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt 0.25in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">This questionnaire will provides us with detailed information about each member of your family and key aspects of their medical history. It is very important for you to list each family member in their respective relationship category, regardless of whether they have had cancer or not. If a family member has had a cancer diagnosis, please provide the name of the tissue or organ in the body from which the cancer first occurred, along with the additional details found on the questionnaire.</p>
<p style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt 0.25in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">After we review the material in your Family History Questionnaire, we may send an email to some of your relatives, including your parents, brothers, sisters, children, and other extended family members, notifying them that we would like to contact them for further information and/or to invite them to participate in this study. <u>If you are willing, we would be most appreciative if you could inform your relatives about your interest in this study.&nbsp; You can let them know that they may be hearing from us to see if they might be willing to be involved in the study as well</u>. Of course, participation is completely voluntary. We expect each family member to decide for themselves whether they wish to take part in the STUDY or not.</p>
<p style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt 0.25in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">If you prefer that we do not use your name, or that we not contact certain relatives, please indicate this on the questionnaire. We will not contact any person who you say should not be contacted.</p>
<p style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt 0.25in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">We realize that you might not have all of the information on all of your relatives, so we have an option to send this form to a more informed family member.&nbsp; You will need the name and email of this person to exercise this option.&nbsp; Otherwise, we ask that you do your best to complete this form as much as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; list-style-position: inside;">
<li style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Individual Information Questionnaire</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt 0.25in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">In this questionnaire we ask you to provide us some specific information about your past medical history and aspects of your health that might relate to risk of cancer, as well as information about screening tests and procedures you may have had.&nbsp; This information is important in our effort to improve the current understanding of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and how it might affect the individuals.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; list-style-position: inside;">
<li style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><strong>Authorization to Obtain Medical Records and Pathology Material Form</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in 6pt 0.25in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The Medical Records and Pathology Release Form grants us permission to contact your health care providers and to obtain copies of medical records and pathology material (if you have had biopsies or surgeries) that will assist us in documenting your medical history. Please sign one of these forms for yourself, and a separate one for each family member for whom you are a parent, guardian or legal representative.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">When all the study materials have been received and reviewed by members of our research group, you may then be invited to participate in the next step of our study. If applicable, we will invite you to take part in genetic counseling and testing, either via telephone or in person as appropriate. We may ask that you send us specimens, such as blood or a mouth wash sample. We will assist you in obtaining these specimens in your home community, and will arrange for those samples to be shipped directly to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">If you would like to reenroll in the study or have any questions or updates, you can contact our Family Studies Referral Nurse by phone (1-800-518-8474) or by email (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="mailto:JanetBracci@westat.com">JanetBracci@westat.com</a>).</p>
